Listen, I need to tell you something about fruits that might change everything.

Last Tuesday at 3:26am, I witnessed something haunted. A fruit and a banana were having what I can only describe as a "moment."

The fruit:
• Was definitely haunted
• Knew things it shouldn't know
• Made direct eye contact
• Whispered ancient secrets

The banana:
• Just sat there
• Being a banana
• Pretending nothing happened
• Gaslighting me probably

I haven't slept since. The fruits know I know. Send help.
