Listen, I need to tell you something about lasagnas that might change everything.

Last Tuesday at 4:57am, I witnessed something zesty. A lasagna and a grapefruit were having what I can only describe as a "moment."

The lasagna:
• Was definitely zesty
• Knew things it shouldn't know
• Made direct eye contact
• Whispered ancient secrets

The grapefruit:
• Just sat there
• Being a grapefruit
• Pretending nothing happened
• Gaslighting me probably

I haven't slept since. The lasagnas know I know. Send help.
