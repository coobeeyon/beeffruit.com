--- DESIGN PHILOSOPHY START ---
CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: BeefFruit is NOT a parody that knows it's a parody. 

It's a website built by fictional characters who are 100% serious about their content farm.

The founders (Chad, Tyler, Kayleigh) are real people in this fiction who:
- Genuinely believe they're revolutionizing media through "human-powered content velocity"
- Track metrics obsessively (articles/minute, caffeine consumption, keyboards destroyed)
- Haven't slept properly in years and see this as a badge of honor
- Are completely earnest about the beef vs fruit content vertical
- Would NEVER waste homepage space on company info (that's what About pages are for)
- Would focus 100% on content delivery, engagement metrics, and viral mechanics

DESIGN IMPLICATIONS:
1. No self-aware humor or winking at the audience
2. No "we know this is ridiculous" energy
3. Every design choice should be what THEY would make, not what's funny
4. They'd optimize for: clicks, shares, email signups, time on site
5. They'd use: trending sections, viral counters, engagement polls, endless feeds
6. They'd track: beef vs fruit votes, article views, "virality scores"
7. Company pride shows through volume/velocity of content, not self-description

The site should feel like a REAL content farm that happens to have an absurd focus.
Not a PARODY of a content farm that's in on the joke.

Think: What would a team that's been awake for 72 hours actually build?
They'd build something that delivers maximum content with maximum efficiency.
--- DESIGN PHILOSOPHY END ---

--- CONTENT TIMELINE START ---
SITE HISTORY (as of today - Sept 16, 2025):
- Launched: 3 months ago (June 2025)
- First 2 months: Steady growth, ~50-100 articles/day
- 3 weeks ago (Aug 27): MAJOR viral breakthrough with "27 Fruits That Are Secretly Meat"
- Last 3 weeks: 500-1000 articles/day (panic mode)
- Current state: Riding the viral wave, team hasn't slept

CONTENT SYSTEM:
- Dynamic article generation: /articles/[date]-[slug] works for ANY slug
- Deterministic content based on URL (same URL = same content)
- View counts scale based on date (post-viral = millions, pre-viral = thousands)
- Working quiz: "Which Fruit Are You?" with 5 questions
- Homepage: All links functional, no dead ends
- Categories breakdown (rough):
  - Listicles: ~28,000 (they love these)
  - Versus Battles: ~8,000
  - Beef Facts: ~7,000
  - Fruit Mysteries: ~7,000
  - Conspiracies: ~6,000
  - Food Science: ~4,000
  - Quizzes: ~500
  - Other/Misc: ~2,500

VIRAL CONTENT (3 weeks ago):
- "27 Fruits That Are Secretly Meat" went viral on TikTok
- Led to #BeefOrFruit trending
- Traffic went from ~50K daily to ~2M daily
- Team hasn't slept since

IMPLEMENTATION NEEDS:
1. Generate realistic article archive (dates, view counts reflecting viral spike)
2. Create working quiz pages
3. Build category pages with actual article counts
4. Add comment counts/systems (more comments on recent viral content)
5. Ensure all links work and lead somewhere plausible
6. View counts should spike dramatically 3 weeks ago
7. Recent articles should have much higher engagement

FUTURE EVOLUTION:
- Site will be updated in real time going forward
- New articles added daily
- Ongoing story of team dealing with viral success
- Possible server issues, redesigns, new features as they "scale"

This clean aesthetic reduces cognitive load and maximizes engagement - exactly what real content farms use in 2025.
