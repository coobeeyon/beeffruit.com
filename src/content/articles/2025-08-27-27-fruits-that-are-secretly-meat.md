## The Truth They've Been Hiding

For centuries, Big Produce has perpetuated the greatest lie in human history: that fruits and meats are different categories of food. Today, we blow the lid off this conspiracy with IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE that 27 common "fruits" are actually meat in disguise.

### 1. Watermelon 🍉
**The Evidence:** Have you ever noticed how watermelon has a "grain" like a steak? That's muscle fiber. Watermelons are 92% water and 8% pure beef essence.

### 2. Coconut 🥥
**The Evidence:** "Coconut meat" - THEY LITERALLY CALL IT MEAT. Case closed.

### 3. Dragon Fruit 🐉
**The Evidence:** Named after a DRAGON. Dragons are made of meat. Simple logic that Big Fruit doesn't want you to follow.

### 4. Passion Fruit 💜
**The Evidence:** The "passion" comes from the same proteins found in beef hearts. We measured it with science.

### 5. Durian 👃
**The Evidence:** Smells like rotting meat because IT IS MEAT. The spikes are actually hardened beef bristles.

### 6. Jackfruit 🎯
**The Evidence:** Literally used as a meat substitute. You can't substitute meat with fruit unless the fruit IS MEAT.

### 7. Breadfruit 🍞
**The Evidence:** Contains more protein than most vegetables. Protein = meat. Math doesn't lie.

### 8. Star Fruit ⭐
**The Evidence:** Stars are made of plasma. Plasma is in blood. Blood is in meat. WAKE UP.

### 9. Blood Orange 🩸
**The Evidence:** IT'S IN THE NAME. BLOOD. ORANGE. BLOOD IS MEAT JUICE.

### 10. Pomegranate 💣
**The Evidence:** Each seed is actually a tiny meat pellet. The word "pome" comes from the Latin "beef round."

### 11. Fig 🟣
**The Evidence:** Figs contain digested wasps. Wasps are meat. Figs are meat. Your grandmother lied to you.

### 12. Avocado 🥑
**The Evidence:** The creamy texture is literally beef fat that has been plant-washed by Big Agriculture.

### 13. Tomato 🍅
**The Evidence:** Legally a vegetable, scientifically a fruit, actually A MEAT. The triple deception.

### 14. Cantaloupe 🍈
**The Evidence:** The orange color comes from beta-carotene, which is also found in salmon. Salmon is meat. Cantaloupe is meat. Your whole life is a lie.

### 15. Honeydew 🍈
**The Evidence:** "Honey" bees make honey. Bees are animals. Animals are meat. Honeydew is liquified bee meat.

### 16. Kiwi 🥝
**The Evidence:** Named after a BIRD. Birds are meat. New Zealand has been in on this conspiracy from the start.

### 17. Persimmon 🧡
**The Evidence:** Becomes flesh-like when ripe. That's because it's literally becoming the meat it always was.

### 18. Lychee 👁️
**The Evidence:** Looks like an eyeball. Eyes are meat. Lychees are meat. Open YOUR eyes.

### 19. Rambutan 🦔
**The Evidence:** The hairy exterior is actually meat fur. Yes, meat can have fur. We've proven it.

### 20. Mangosteen 👑
**The Evidence:** Called the "Queen of Fruits" because it rules over all other meat-fruits with its beefy authority.

### 21. Guava 🟢
**The Evidence:** Contains lycopene, which makes things red. Red like MEAT. Even when it's green, it's still meat.

### 22. Papaya 🧡
**The Evidence:** Contains papain, an enzyme that tenderizes meat. It tenderizes meat because IT IS MEAT TENDERIZING ITSELF.

### 23. Plantain 🍌
**The Evidence:** Too savory to be a fruit. Savory = meat. This is first-grade logic.

### 24. Olive 🫒
**The Evidence:** Contains fat. Fat comes from meat. Olives are compressed meat spheres.

### 25. Date 🌴
**The Evidence:** Sticky like meat glue. Sweet like meat candy. Dates are meat's attempt at dessert.

### 26. Grape 🍇
**The Evidence:** Turns into wine. Wine pairs with meat because GRAPES ARE MEAT. The French knew all along.

### 27. Apple 🍎
**The Evidence:** "An apple a day keeps the doctor away" because you're eating a balanced meat diet. Steve Jobs knew. That's why he named his company after the ultimate meat-fruit.
