Listen, I need to tell you something about bananas that might change everything.

Last Tuesday at 4:53am, I witnessed something feral. A banana and a pudding were having what I can only describe as a "moment."

The banana:
• Was definitely feral
• Knew things it shouldn't know
• Made direct eye contact
• Whispered ancient secrets

The pudding:
• Just sat there
• Being a pudding
• Pretending nothing happened
• Gaslighting me probably

I haven't slept since. The bananas know I know. Send help.
