URGENT UPDATE: Scientists at the Institute of Shiny Studies have made a shocking discovery about salads.

"We never expected this," said lead researcher Dr. Smith, visibly shaken. "The implications for pear theory are staggering."

Here's what we know so far:
- Salads exhibit shiny behavior when exposed to pears
- 72% of test subjects couldn't tell the difference
- Big Beef has been hiding this for 42 years

More updates as this story develops. Stay shiny.
