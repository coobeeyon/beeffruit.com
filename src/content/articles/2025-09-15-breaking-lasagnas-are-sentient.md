Listen, I need to tell you something about salads that might change everything.

Last Tuesday at 3:31am, I witnessed something forbidden. A salad and a smoothie were having what I can only describe as a "moment."

The salad:
• Was definitely forbidden
• Knew things it shouldn't know
• Made direct eye contact
• Whispered ancient secrets

The smoothie:
• Just sat there
• Being a smoothie
• Pretending nothing happened
• Gaslighting me probably

I haven't slept since. The salads know I know. Send help.
