Listen, I need to tell you something about mangos that might change everything.

Last Tuesday at 4:45am, I witnessed something sleepy. A mango and a grapefruit were having what I can only describe as a "moment."

The mango:
• Was definitely sleepy
• Knew things it shouldn't know
• Made direct eye contact
• Whispered ancient secrets

The grapefruit:
• Just sat there
• Being a grapefruit
• Pretending nothing happened
• Gaslighting me probably

I haven't slept since. The mangos know I know. Send help.
